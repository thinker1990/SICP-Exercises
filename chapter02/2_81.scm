;; 1. Q: What happens if apply-generic is called with two arguments of type scheme-number 
;;       or two arguments of type complex for an operation that is not found in the table for those types?
;;    A: The apply-generic will enter infinite recursion, each recursion try to coerce two argument to the same type,
;;       but they already are the same type.
;;    Q: What happens if we call exp with two complex numbers as arguments?
;;    A: Since we don't have coercion procedure complex->scheme-number install into coercion table, 
;;       and apply-generic keep trying to coerce to the same type (that is complex), so it will enter
;;       infinite recursion too.
;; 
;; 2. Q: Is Louis correct that something had to be done about coercion with arguments of the same type?
;;    A: No, it is unnecessary.
;;    Q: Does apply-generic work correctly as is?
;;    A: Absolutly.
;;
;; 3. Modify apply-generic so that it doesnâ€™t try coercion if the two arguments have the same type.

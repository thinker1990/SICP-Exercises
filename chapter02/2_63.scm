;; a. The two procedures produce the same result for every tree.

;; Solution from: https://wizardbook.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/exercise-2-63/
;; b. tree->list-1 visits each tree item once and at each visit it uses append so its growth is O(n . append) 
;;    assuming a balanced tree then append will be O(n/2 + n/4 + n/8 â€¦) = O(log n)
;;    So tree->list-1 is O(n log n)
;; 
;;    tree->list-2 visits each tree item once and at each visit it uses cons 
;;    So its growth is O(1.n) = O(n)

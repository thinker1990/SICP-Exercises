;; Answer from: http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-4.71
;; This will postpone some infinite loop. for example: 
;;  (assert! (married Minnie Mickey)) 
;;  (assert! (rule (married ?x ?y) 
;;                 (married ?y ?x))) 
;;  (married Mickey ?who) 
;;  if we don't use delay, there is no answer to display. but if we use it, we can get: 
;;  ;;; Query output: 
;;  (married Mickey Minnie) 
;;  (married Mickey Minnie) 
;;  (married Mickey Minnie) 
;;  .... 
;;  this is better than nothing. the reason of this difference is that 
;;  in this example (apply-rules query-pattern frame) will lead to infinite loop, 
;;  if we delay it, we still can get some meaningful answers.
